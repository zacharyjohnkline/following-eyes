# Following Eyes Project

This project is designed as a progamming exercise to showcase my ability to manipulate DOM elements.  I decided to take it a step further than what was required and make it into a goofy little game where the goal is to feed the face flies.  

• You start the 'game' by clicking anywhere and the cursor turns into a fly. 

• Watch as the eyes follow the cursor around the page and the mouse opens.

• When you hover the cursor/fly over the mouth of the character, it quickly closes and it gets added to the number of flies eaten.

• After you have fed the face the first fly, you MUST click on the button at the bottom left labeld with a .gif of the fly and the word click! in order to turn the cursor back into a fly and proceed feeding the face.

• When you get to multiples of 10 flies, you get a congratulatory message.

## Future Improvements

I was thinking of creating significantly better graphics for this, but for this use case, I was utilizing only html and css for most of the graphics, with the exception of the fly cursor.
